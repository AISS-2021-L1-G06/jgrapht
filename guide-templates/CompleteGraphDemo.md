Here is a snippet of code:

```java
:[source code](http://code.jgrapht.org/raw/master/jgrapht-demo/src/main/java/org/jgrapht/demo/CompleteGraphDemo.java?example=generate)
```

Here is an entire class:

```java
:[source code](http://code.jgrapht.org/raw/master/jgrapht-demo/src/main/java/org/jgrapht/demo/CompleteGraphDemo.java?example=class)
```

And here is an entire file (but with the @example directives omitted):

```java
:[source code](http://code.jgrapht.org/raw/master/jgrapht-demo/src/main/java/org/jgrapht/demo/CompleteGraphDemo.java)
```

Below is the same file, including the @example directives:

```java
:[source code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jgrapht/jgrapht/master/jgrapht-demo/src/main/java/org/jgrapht/demo/CompleteGraphDemo.java)
```

Can you think of any ways it could be improved?
